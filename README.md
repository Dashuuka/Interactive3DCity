# 3D City with Dynamic Day-Night Cycle  

This project is an interactive 3D city visualization created using the **Three.js** library. The city includes buildings, parks, roads, moving cars, clouds, and a dynamic day-night cycle. Users can control city parameters such as building density, height, park coverage, and time of day.  

## Key Features  

- **Dynamic City**:  
  - Buildings, parks, and roads are randomly generated based on user-defined parameters.  
  - Moving cars that drive on roads and make turns at intersections.  
  - Clouds smoothly drifting across the sky.  

- **Day-Night Cycle**:  
  - Realistic lighting changes based on the time of day.  
  - Car headlights and building windows light up at night.  

- **Interactive Controls**:  
  - Sliders to adjust city parameters: building density, height, park coverage, map size, and time of day.  
  - Ability to rotate and zoom the camera using the mouse.  

## Technologies  

- **Three.js**: Core library for 3D graphics.  
- **JavaScript**: Primary programming language.  
- **HTML/CSS**: For interface display and integration with Three.js.  

## How to Use  

1. Open the [live version of the project](https://dashuuka.github.io/pkgLabs_6/).  
2. Use the sliders in the control panel to adjust city parameters.  
3. Observe real-time changes:  
   - Addition/removal of buildings and parks.  
   - Lighting changes based on the time of day.  
   - Movement of cars and clouds.  

## Installation and Setup  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/dashuuka/pkgLabs_6.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash  
   cd pkgLabs_6  
   ```  
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  

## Potential Improvements  

- Adding pedestrians and other urban elements.  
- Implementing weather effects (rain, snow).  
- Optimizing rendering for better performance.
